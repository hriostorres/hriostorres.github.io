## 📍Macalester College

At Macalester, I'm pursuing a double major in **Economics** and **Statistics**, along with a minor in **French**.

As of now, I've served as a Teaching Assistant (**TA**) for **Calculus II** and **Statistical Modeling**. This upcoming semester, Fall 2025, I will be the TA for **Intermediate Macroeconomics**, and **Machine Learning**. As you may have perceived, I love teaching!

Additionally, I've participated in research and training programs such as the [Expanding Diversity in Economics](https://www.macalester.edu/news/2024/04/three-macalester-students-selected-for-university-of-chicagos-prestigious-economics-program/) (EDE) Program at the University of Chicago in the Summer of 2024 and the [Mathematical Modeling and Public Health Workshop](https://hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/news/mathematical-modeling-and-public-health-workshop/) at Harvard Chan School in March 2025.

### 🧗🏼 Hobbies

      Outside the classroom, I love being active and exploring nature. I've been getting into bouldering and sport climbing, mostly indoors. Climbing challenges me to stay focused and push my limits, both mentally and physically.

      I also enjoy running, apnea diving, and trying out new restaurants. These hobbies keep me grounded, adventurous, and open to discovery.

## 🏫  UWC RCN: High School

I attended the [UWC Red Cross Nordic](https://www.uwc.org/rcn) (UWCRCN), located in Flekke, Norway. UWC makes **education** a **force** to **unite people, nations and cultures** for **peace** and a **sustainable** **future.**

While in Norway, I pursued the International Baccalaureate (IB) and had the honor of representing the UWC movement and my school at [the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony in December 2022](https://uwcrcn.no/nobel-peace-prize_2022/). Beyond academics, I spent my time hiking, diving, and growing—personally, intellectually, and spiritually.
