## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Macalester College

At Macalester, I'm pursuing a double major in **Economics** and **Statistics**, along with a minor in **French**.

As of now, I've served as a Teaching Assistant (**TA**) for **Calculus II** and **Statistical Modeling**. This upcoming semester, Fall 2025, I will be the TA for **Intermediate Macroeconomics**, and **Machine Learning**. As you may have perceived, I love teaching!

Additionally, I've participated in research and training programs such as the [Expanding Diversity in Economics](https://www.macalester.edu/news/2024/04/three-macalester-students-selected-for-university-of-chicagos-prestigious-economics-program/) (EDE) Program at the University of Chicago in the Summer of 2024 and the [Mathematical Modeling and Public Health Workshop](https://hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/news/mathematical-modeling-and-public-health-workshop/) at Harvard Chan School in March 2025.

You can find me exploring extreme sports, cooking, or watching movies when I'm not diving into research or crunching numbers.

## ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ High School: UWCRCN

I attended the [UWC Red Cross Nordic](https://www.uwc.org/rcn) (UWCRCN), located in Flekke, Norway. UWC makes **education** a **force** to **unite people, nations and cultures** for **peace** and a **sustainable** **future.**

While in Norway, I pursued the International Baccalaureate (IB) and had the honor of representing the UWC movement and my school at [the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony in December 2022](https://uwcrcn.no/nobel-peace-prize_2022/). Beyond academics, I spent my time hiking, diving, and growingâ€”personally, intellectually, and spiritually.
