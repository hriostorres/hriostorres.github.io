## ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Macalester College

At Macalester, I'm pursuing a double major in **Economics** and **Statistics**, along with a minor in **French**.

As of now, I've served as a Teaching Assistant (**TA**) for **Applied Multivariable Calculus II** and Introduction to **Statistical Modeling**. This upcoming semester, Fall 2025, I will be the TA for **Intermediate Macroeconomics**, and **Machine Learning**. As you may have perceived, I love teaching!

My research interests focus primarily on development economics, immigration, and labor market inequalities. My research for my Econometrics class analyzed wage disparities among immigrant workers, emphasizing intersections of gender and citizenship.

Additionally, I've participated in research and training programs such as the [Expanding Diversity in Economics](https://www.macalester.edu/news/2024/04/three-macalester-students-selected-for-university-of-chicagos-prestigious-economics-program/) (EDE) Program at the University of Chicago in the Summer of 2024 and the [Mathematical Modeling and Public Health Workshop](https://hsph.harvard.edu/epidemiology/news/mathematical-modeling-and-public-health-workshop/) at Harvard Chan School in March 2025.

You can find me exploring extreme sports, cooking, or watching movies when I'm not diving into research or crunching numbers.

## ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ High School: UWCRCN

I attended the [UWC Red Cross Nordic](https://www.uwc.org/rcn) (UWCRCN), located in Flekke, Norway. UWC makes **education** a **force** to **unite people, nations and cultures** for **peace** and a **sustainable** **future.**

While in Norway, I studied the International Baccalaureate (IB), taking Global Politics, Spanish Literature, English B, French ab initio, Math Analysis and Approaches, and Physics. During my time there, I also enjoyed hiking and diving, and experienced personal, academic, and spiritual growth.
