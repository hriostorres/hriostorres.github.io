## Wage Disparities Research

In my Econometrics class, I researched wage disparities based on gender and citizenship status in the U.S. under the supervision of Prof. Amy Damon. This study used the ACS Data from 2012-2019. I utilized a Mincer earnings regression and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to estimate wage differentials while controlling for human capital characteristics, sociodemographic factors, and industry and geographic fixed effects. Results: females earn approximately 32.7% less than males, primarily due to intangible factors such as employer bias and statistical discrimination. The analysis further reveals that non-citizen women face an additional 7.9% wage penalty beyond the independent effects of gender and citizenship alone.
