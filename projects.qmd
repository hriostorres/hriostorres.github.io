## Wage Disparities Research

In my Econometrics class, I researched wage disparities based on gender and citizenship status in the U.S. under the supervision of Prof. Amy Damon. This study used the ACS Data from 2012-2019. My research focused on foreign-born workers in the agriculture, construction, and service sectorsâ€”industries where immigrant labor is most concentrated as seen in the figure below.

I utilized a Mincer earnings regression (see equation below) and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to estimate wage differentials while controlling for human capital characteristics, sociodemographic factors, and industry and geographic fixed effects.

$$
\begin{align}
\ln(wage_{i,s,t}) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 \, \textit{Citizen}_{i,s,t} + \beta_2 \, \textit{Sex}_{i,s,t} + \beta_3 \, (\textit{Citizen} \times \textit{Sex})_{i,s,t} \\
&\quad + \mathbf{X}'_{i,s,t} \beta_4 + \sum_{s=1}^{S} \gamma_s D_{s,i} + \sum_{t=1}^{T} \tau_t D_{t,i} \\
&\quad + \sum_{j=1}^{J} \theta_j D_{j,i} + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \delta_k D_{k,i} + \epsilon_{i,s,t}
\end{align}
$$

where $$ \mathbf{X}'_{i,s,t} $$ includes education, experience, and English proficiency, and fixed effects control for geography, year, industry, and birthplace.

**Results?**

-   Females earn approximately 32.7% less than males, primarily due to intangible factors such as employer bias and statistical discrimination.

-   The analysis further reveals that non-citizen women face an additional 7.9% wage penalty beyond the independent effects of gender and citizenship alone.

-   Additionally, Naturalized citizens earn about 3.7% more than native-born citizens, likely due to positive selection and legal protections.
