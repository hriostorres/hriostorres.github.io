    "text": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Macalester College\nAt Macalester, Iâ€™m pursuing a double major in Economics and Statistics, along with a minor in French.\nAs of now, Iâ€™ve served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Applied Multivariable Calculus II and Introduction to Statistical Modeling. This upcoming semester, Fall 2025, I will be the TA for Intermediate Macroeconomics, and Machine Learning. As you may have perceived, I love teaching!\nMy research interests focus primarily on development economics, immigration, and labor market inequalities. My research for my Econometrics class analyzed wage disparities among immigrant workers, emphasizing intersections of gender and citizenship.\nAdditionally, Iâ€™ve participated in research and training programs such as the Expanding Diversity in Economics (EDE) Program at the University of Chicago in the Summer of 2024 and the Mathematical Modeling and Public Health Workshop at Harvard Chan School in March 2025.\nYou can find me exploring extreme sports, cooking, or watching movies when Iâ€™m not diving into research or crunching numbers."
