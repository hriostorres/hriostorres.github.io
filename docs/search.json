    "text": "Results?\n\nFemales earn approximately 32.7% less than males, primarily due to intangible factors such as employer bias and statistical discrimination.\nThe analysis further reveals that non-citizen women face an additional 7.9% wage penalty beyond the independent effects of gender and citizenship alone.\nAdditionally, Naturalized citizens earn about 3.7% more than native-born citizens, likely due to positive selection and legal protections.\n\n\nThis paper is in the process of being published at the Macalester Street Journal."
