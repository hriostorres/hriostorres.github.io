UWC makes education a force to unite people, nations and cultures for peace and a sustainable future.\nWhile in Norway, I pursued the International Baccalaureate (IB) and had the honor of representing the UWC movement and my school at the Nobel Peace Prize Ceremony in December 2022. Beyond academics, I spent my time hiking, diving, and growingâ€”personally, intellectually, and spiritually."
