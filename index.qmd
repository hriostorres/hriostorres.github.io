I am Hermogenes David Riosâ€”Hermogenes is my first name, David is my middle name, and Rios is my last name. Hermogenes comes from a family tradition: it's passed down to the first-born child of each generation. I'm from Bolivia and am currently studying in the U.S. at Macalester College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Learn more [about me](about.qmd) and my work.
